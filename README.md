# Microservices-Project

This project involves the development of two microservices, one built using Django (admin) and the other using Flask (main), which work together by communicating and exchanging data. The communication between these microservices is facilitated through an API, and a message broker called RabbitMQ is used to ensure reliable message delivery and update their respective databases.
